# What is this project?
This piece of work evidences an assignment set by MMU.
I have produced a digital artifact, which is a novel piece of software. 
I have written the programming code for this software using the programming language Java.
The software has been developed iteratively over the course of a trimester, with support and direction given throughout.

This piece of software exhibits the following programming concepts:
- Console output
- User input
- Selection (If, If-else, Switch)
- Loops
- Methods
- Arrays
- Testing
- Objects

|86-100     |Additional Features  |Self-directed code management    |
|75-85      |Feature set 2        |Appropriate package structure    |
|60-74      |Feature set 1        |Extensive comments               |
|50-59      |Arrays, Testing      |Consistent indentation           |
|40-49      |Loops, Methods       |Variables named appropriately    |
|20-39      |Selection            |Partial code submitted           |
|0-19       |Basic user input     |Little or no code submitted      |

Based on this guide table, I would place myself:
