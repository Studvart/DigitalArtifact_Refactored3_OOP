In this assignment you will produce a digital artefact, which is a novel piece of software. You will write the programming code for this software using the programming language Java. The software that you develop will be built iteratively over the course of the semester, with support and direction given throughout the weekly lab sessions.
The piece of software that you develop will exhibit the following programming concepts:
o Console output
o User input
o Selection (If, If-else, Switch)
o Loops
o Methods
o Arrays
o Testing
o Objects
